# Happy Customers

# Introduction: 
Built a Machine Learning model that could predict which one of the customers is satisfied based on the quality of provided services survey for the Logistics and Delivery field.

# Data Description:
The Dataset has 6 Columns in addition of the Targeted Column (Y), the idea is to identify and predict about how much the Customer is happy and satisfied with his order ranged increasingly from X1 up to X6.

# Methodology:
1. Applying Correlation Coefficient technique to measure the  relationship between the columns and their closeness to the Target Column (Y).
2. Selecting the most relevent Column to the Targeted Column (Y) from X1 to X6 and removing the rest of the Columns.
3. Splitting the Dataset into 80% for training set and 20% for testing set.
4. Building the Machine Learning model using Naive-Bayes algorithm and SVM algorithm.

# Conclusion: 
The result reached to 73% of Accuracy for detecting the customers happiness using SVM algorithm.
